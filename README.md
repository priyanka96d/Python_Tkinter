This repo contain a script and output document. Script has been designed and developed to create a user-friendly GUI for a Gardening/Nursery shop. 
It enables users to select various types of plants such as vegetables, flowers, and herbs, categorized according to three seasons: Fall, Summer, and Spring. 
The graphical user interface (GUI) has been implemented using the tkinter module in Python. 
To interact with the data, a MongoDB database has been employed. 
The GUI incorporates a canvas for displaying images of the selected plants. 
The data is stored in CSV file format, which allows easy access to information for each selection made from the database.
**Versions Used:**
- Python Version: 3.7.3
- MongoDB Version: v4.0.10
